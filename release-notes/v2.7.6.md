#### <sub><sup><a name="v276-note-1" href="#v276-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* We forgot to add the BOSH properties for configuring InfluxDB. Ignore these release notes and read [**v2.7.5**](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v2.7.5) and pretend that we didn't mess up.
  
  Thanks.
