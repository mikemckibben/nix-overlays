#### <sub><sup><a name="v334-note-1" href="#v334-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* A migration introduced in [**v3.3.0**](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v3.3.0) would load all the builds into memory and then process them, causing a lot of issues when upgrading. We  optimized this migration to migrate build plans in batches, rather than all at once.

* The `unpack` support for the [`s3` resource](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource) will no longer load the entire archive into memory, so it can be used for larger archives, thanks to a PR by @krishicks!
