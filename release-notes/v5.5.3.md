* This is a Security patch using GoLang v1.13.1 that address a recently reported issue with Go net/http (CVE-2019-16276). 
  GoLang's net/http (through net/textproto) used to accept and normalize invalid HTTP/1.1 headers with a space before the colon, in violation of RFC 7230. If a Go server is used behind an uncommon reverse proxy that accepts and forwards but doesn't normalize such invalid headers, the reverse proxy and the server can interpret the headers differently. This can lead to filter bypasses or request smuggling.
