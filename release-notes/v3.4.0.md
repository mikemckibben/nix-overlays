* We've deprecated our `concourse/lite` Vagrant box in favor of a `bosh create-env` flow. This will be much easier for us to maintain and brings a lot more flexibility around configuring and upgrading Concourse.

* We've parallelized garbage collection. This should make things more durable to a slow worker, and make it harder for containers and volumes to "pile up" when the ATC is out of service briefly (i.e. during a deploy). [Yee.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6EoRBvdVPQ)

* You can now set [**`image_resource.version`**](https://concourse-ci.org/tasks.html#image-resource-version) on an [**`image_resource`**](https://concourse-ci.org/tasks.html#image_resource), thanks to a PR by @krishicks!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v340-note-8" href="#v340-note-8">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* We've removed the volume size column from [`fly` CLI](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html) ... previously it was always empty and no one seemed to care.

* The [`fly validate-pipeline`](https://concourse-ci.org/setting-pipelines.html#fly-validate-pipeline) command can now be provided with variables in the same way that [`fly set-pipeline`](https://concourse-ci.org/setting-pipelines.html#fly-set-pipeline) can, thanks to a PR by @jmcarp!

* The [`git` resource](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource) will now save the committer email to `.git/committer`, thanks to a PR by @knifhen!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v340-note-13" href="#v340-note-13">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* Jobs with a pending build now have a static halo to better represent its waiting state, thanks to a PR by @d!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v340-note-14" href="#v340-note-14">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* [`fly` CLI](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html) learned the [`fly format-pipeline`](https://concourse-ci.org/setting-pipelines.html#fly-format-pipeline) command, thanks to a PR by @krishicks!

* BaggageClaim's response header timeout is now configurable, which should help those with large images that they're using for privileged tasks. This is a band-aid; we'll soon be making the API this is relevant to async.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v340-note-17" href="#v340-note-17">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Files with the `setuid` and `setgid` permissions set on them will no longer have them removed. This used to be lost with the `chown` performed for namespacing the files. We'll now restore it after the `chown`.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v340-note-18" href="#v340-note-18">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* The flags for configuring GitLab oAuth are now present in [`fly set-team`](https://concourse-ci.org/managing-teams.html#fly-set-team).
