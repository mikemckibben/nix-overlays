#### <sub><sup><a name="v521-note-1" href="#v521-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* The web UI used to [silently break](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3141) when your token (which includes a potentially-long JSON-encoded string detailing all the teams you are part of and what roles you have on them) was longer than the size of a single cookie (4096 bytes on most browsers!). This limit has been increased 15-fold, which should unblock most users on clusters with a lot of teams concourse/concourse#4280.
