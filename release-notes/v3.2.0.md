#### <sub><sup><a name="v320-note-1" href="#v320-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* We've pulled in a newer, less crappy templating system for [`fly` CLI](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html)! New params look like `((this))` and support more than just strings: boolean values, arrays, and other YAML structures can be templated in. It also supports one big thing you've all been waiting for: `inter((pola))tion`!
  
  The older, rougher-around-the-edges `{{og-params}}` are still supported and behave exactly as they did before. You should switch to the new style at your earliest convenience, but we have no immediate plans to remove the old style as it's really not that annoying to just leave in place.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v320-note-2" href="#v320-note-2">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix, breaking

* As part of our params rejigger, we no longer support specifying maps as arrays of maps. We have no idea how or why this worked previously, but we never intentionally supported it, and won't be bringing this back. For slightly more context, see concourse/concourse#1307.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v320-note-3" href="#v320-note-3">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* The Docker repository now supports resolving addresses within Concourse containers via Docker's magic local DNS server! This fixes a longstanding hurdle our Docker users would run in to pretty frequently when wanting to e.g. point Concourse at other Docker-deployed things like a registry within the cluster. It also removes the need for setting `CONCOURSE_GARDEN_DNS_SERVER`.
  
  No configuration is necessary for this change.

* We've made substantial improvements to our schema that should dramatically reduce utilization of your database, especially for larger deployments. On our own instance we saw Postgres CPU usage drop from ~25% to ~7%. Larger instances will likely see a more substantial impact.

* [`fly` CLI](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html) now supports tab-completion of pipeline names, thanks to a PR by @jmcarp!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v320-note-6" href="#v320-note-6">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* As part of the schema improvements, we've fixed a couple edge cases that could result in a container or volume for a [`get` step](https://concourse-ci.org/get-step.html) being brutally murdered in the middle of a build running. We will now also wait for [`get` step](https://concourse-ci.org/get-step.html)s to finish when draining a worker.
  
  We're sorry, [`get` step](https://concourse-ci.org/get-step.html). You deserved better.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v320-note-7" href="#v320-note-7">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* We've fixed a goroutine leak and generally redone how the `radar` component of the ATC scans for resource versions. As a result of this, the goroutine count dropped by just over 50%.
