* A bug introduced by [**v1.4.0**](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v1.4.0) caused custom resource types that override worker-provided resource types (e.g. `git`, `s3`, `docker-image`) to lead to containers being created repeatedly until your workers couldn't take anymore.
  
  Fixed. Our bad.

* The TLS redirecting feature introduced as part of [**v1.3.0**](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v1.3.0) made [`fly execute`](https://concourse-ci.org/running-tasks.html#fly-execute) work only 50% of the time when running two ATCs. With three ATCs it would work 33.3%, repeating of course, of the time, and so on.
  
  [`fly execute`](https://concourse-ci.org/running-tasks.html#fly-execute) now works 100% of the time.

* The commit message format in the [`pool` resource](https://github.com/concourse/pool-resource) has been once again tweaked so as to not incorrectly trigger GitHub's issue reference syntax, thanks to a PR from @geramirez.
