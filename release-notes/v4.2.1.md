#### <sub><sup><a name="v421-note-1" href="#v421-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix, security

* Fixed a bug in the access checking logic for a few worker-related API endpoints. This was introduced in [**v4.0.0**](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v4.0.0).
  
  Specifically, the API allowed any logged-in user to prune, retire, and land workers, in addition to performing a few harmless internal garbage-collection calls.
  
  Thankfully, the impact of this is fairly small, as the worst someone can do is make your workers become landing or retiring. Which is annoying, but at least there is no risk of gaining access to any of your workers or sensitive pipeline data.
