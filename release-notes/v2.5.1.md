* Soooo you may have noticed Chrome being really slow lately, especially the autocomplete in the URL bar. We had a bug that led to an infinite redirect loop, causing a bunch of very large URLs to enter the browser history. We've fixed this now. You may want to clear your history to speed Chrome up again. Sorry.

* The [`docker-image` resource](https://github.com/concourse/docker-image-resource) will now propagate the correct `--mtu` value to the daemon, fixing image fetching flakiness on IaaSes like GCP, which have a default MTU lower than `1500`.

* When using `--ca-cert` with [`fly login`](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html#fly-login), the cert will be appended to the system cert pool, rather than an empty pool. This way the cert will be verified in the case where it's an intermediate cert signed by a root CA in the system pool.
