#### <sub><sup><a name="v201-note-1" href="#v201-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Previously if you were using Safari the pipeline would not render. Well, technically, it would render, but within a `<div>` element with 0px height. We have sighed, flailed at the CSS monster, triggered our [`web-development` pipeline](https://ci.concourse-ci.org/teams/main/pipelines/web-development), and prevailed.
  
  Also the top bar used to shrivel up and die if the size of the content page became too large. It, uh, doesn't anymore.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v201-note-2" href="#v201-note-2">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* We've restored the pre-teams API endpoint for the job status badges, so you all don't have to update your READMEs immediately. Sorry about that. (You should probably still update them, though.)
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v201-note-3" href="#v201-note-3">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* We've improved the error message returned when the [**`file`**](https://concourse-ci.org/task-step.html#task-step-file) used by a [`task` step](https://concourse-ci.org/task-step.html) does not exist.
