* We've reduced the number of queries by about 60%, including removing constant write loads which may have led to increased CPU usage on RDS.

* The resource page is now much much more responsive. We've rewritten it in Elm, implementing live-updating along the way. It used to take a few (maybe quite a few) seconds to load, and now takes on the order of milliseconds. Pretty rad.

* Triggering a build will now update the UI in-place rather than redirecting.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v210-note-4" href="#v210-note-4">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Autoscrolling is back and better than ever before. Keyboard controls for scrolling (e.g. Cmd+Down, Spacebar) should also now work as normal.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v210-note-5" href="#v210-note-5">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* We've updated to Go 1.7.1, which should fix a few DNS-related quirks.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v210-note-6" href="#v210-note-6">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Cmd-click and other non-vanilla clicks should now work for build links in the header of the build view.

* The ATC can now be configured with a `--auth-duration` flag, making the duration for which tokens are valid configurable. This is thanks to a PR from @fmy!

* The [`git` resource](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource) now supports GPG verification for commits, thanks to a PR from @alext!

* The [`docker-image` resource](https://github.com/concourse/docker-image-resource) now emits the output of `docker inspect <image>` as `docker_inspect.json`, thanks to a PR from @endzyme!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v210-note-10" href="#v210-note-10">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* Concourse now rejects traffic from web crawlers by providing a `robots.txt`. We may make this a bit more targeted in the future, but the intent is to reduce unwanted traffic as there are many many many links to click in Concourse.

* Thanks to @databus23 the Docker Image resource can now cache things once again! This regressed with Docker 1.10 as the semantics for caching and layer reuse changed to require some additional work/metadata.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v210-note-12" href="#v210-note-12">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* The [`git` resource](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource) now supports `[skip ci]` in addition to `[ci skip]`, thanks to @fmy!
