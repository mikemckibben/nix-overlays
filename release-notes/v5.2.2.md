#### <sub><sup><a name="v522-note-1" href="#v522-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* This release simply involves rebuilding Concourse with go 1.12.9 to fix CVE-2019-9512 and CVE-2019-9514. Neither of these is very likely to affect Concourse users in the first place, but we are releasing a patch for good measure.
