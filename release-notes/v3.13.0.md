* The dashboard now supports the "not" operator for searches. This can be used on pipeline name searches, team searches, and status searches. Here are some examples:
  
  
  
  * `-main` gives you every pipeline other than the one called `main`
    
    
  
  * `team:-main` gives you every team's pipeline other than the ones belonging to `main`
    
    
  
  * `status:-paused` gives you all pipelines that are not paused
