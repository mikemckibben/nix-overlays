Y'all really carried us on this release. We just shipped it. Thanks everyone!

#### <sub><sup><a name="v380-note-1" href="#v380-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* The ATC can now be configured with an idle timeout for [`fly intercept`](https://concourse-ci.org/builds.html#fly-intercept) sessions, thanks to a PR by @sharms and @jmcarp!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v380-note-2" href="#v380-note-2">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* In [**v3.7.0**](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v3.7.0) we broke the ability for BOSH deployed workers to configure an external TSA - the `known_hosts` file would be empty on the machine. Sorry about that! This should work again. Thanks for the PR, @christianang!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v380-note-3" href="#v380-note-3">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Also in [**v3.7.0**](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v3.7.0) we mistakenly provided a default empty value for the now-required `token_signing_key` property on the `atc` and `tsa` jobs in the BOSH release. This is now removed, so you can get a nice juicy template resolution error rather than a busted deployment.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v380-note-4" href="#v380-note-4">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* The container placement strategy can now be configured in the BOSH release, thanks to a PR by @williammartin.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v380-note-5" href="#v380-note-5">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* The Generic oAuth provider can now be configured with a CA certificate, thanks to a PR by @rkoster!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v380-note-6" href="#v380-note-6">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Fixed a typo in the new Prometheus metrics endpoint that prevented volume count metrics from being emitted. Thanks @jmcarp!
