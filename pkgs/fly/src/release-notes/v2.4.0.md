* Worker keys can now be authorized for only a particular team. This prevents workers from being unintentionally (or maliciously) registered as a global worker, in the case where an operator is granting an external worker access to the cluster.
  
  Consult `web --help` for CLI docs or [bosh.io](http://bosh.io/jobs/tsa?source=github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-release) for BOSH docs.

* We've lowered the default memory/CPU usage of the `concourse/lite` Vagrant box to 2GB and 2 cores, down from 6GB and four cores, thanks to a PR from @jwiebalk!

* Baggageclaim will now be more durable to corrupt volumes. Previously a borked metadata file would effectively wedge the Baggageclaim API, making the worker unrecoverable. You would see an error like "failed to list volumes" in your builds. Baggageclaim will now pretend these volumes don't exist in the API, and reap them from the disk.

* [**`on_failure`**](https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html#job-on-failure), [**`on_success`**](https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html#job-on-success), and [**`ensure`**](https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html#job-ensure) can now be attached to a job, thanks to a PR from @jmcarp!

* [`fly login`](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html#fly-login) will now automatically transfer the token to the CLI for the oAuth flow, rather than requiring you to copy-paste it.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v240-note-6" href="#v240-note-6">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Fixed the behavior of the "home" button. It will now take you to your current pipeline, rather than always taking you to the first one.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v240-note-7" href="#v240-note-7">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* After logging in, the UI will now reflect that you're actually logged in. This used to require a refresh. Single page apps giveth and they taketh away.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v240-note-8" href="#v240-note-8">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* When viewing a build or a job, the groups the job are in will now be highlighted, rather than always the first group.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v240-note-9" href="#v240-note-9">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Fixed a janky synchronization issues when updating the top bar while switching between pipelines; it used to sometimes show the previous pipeline and never update.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v240-note-10" href="#v240-note-10">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* The favicon will now reset back to the default "grey" flavor when switching from a build to any other page.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v240-note-11" href="#v240-note-11">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* Logging in will now redirect you back to where you were if it was initiated by some attempted action.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v240-note-12" href="#v240-note-12">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* The [`bosh-io-stemcell` resource](https://github.com/concourse/bosh-io-stemcell-resource) now correctly returns versions in chronological order.
