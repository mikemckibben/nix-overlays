* We now provide an official Docker repository at `concourse/concourse`!
  
  As part of this, the [binary distribution](https://concourse-ci.org/install.html) has been updated to support environment variables for configuration, in addition to flags. Because [the environment is perfectly safe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m5qxZm_JqM).
  
  Thanks to @gregarcara and @MeteoGroup for maintaining Concourse images until we started on this ourselves!

* The [`bosh-io-release` resource](https://github.com/concourse/bosh-io-release-resource) will now verify SHA1 checksums, and place them in the fetched directory as `sha1`. The [`bosh-io-stemcell` resource](https://github.com/concourse/bosh-io-stemcell-resource) has also been updated so that they both have the same behavior.
