#### <sub><sup><a name="v332-note-1" href="#v332-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix, security

* Fixed a vulnerability affecting installations using untrusted multi-tenancy (i.e. multiple teams who may be jerks). This issue affects all versions after and including [**v2.7.1**](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v2.7.1).
  
  If you are running a single-tenant Concourse installation, or an installation where all team members are "trusted" (i.e. part of your small org), you don't have much to worry about. Otherwise, you'll want to upgrade to this as soon as possible.
  
  We strongly recommend upgrading as soon as possible.
