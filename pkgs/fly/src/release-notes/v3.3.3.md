#### <sub><sup><a name="v333-note-1" href="#v333-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* Added support for `params` in [**`image_resource`**](https://concourse-ci.org/tasks.html#image_resource). This probably should've always been there, but hey at least its there now!
  
  
 #### <sub><sup><a name="v333-note-2" href="#v333-note-2">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* The [`s3` resource](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource) supports `unpack`, which unarchives a tar/zip file on the `get` command. This enables s3 to be a provider for [**`image_resource`**](https://concourse-ci.org/tasks.html#image_resource) docker images. Thanks to a PR by @krishicks!
