* [**v0.75.0**](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v0.75.0) introduced a client-side limit of 64 connections to the database, which no one would ever hit so we didn't bother putting it in the release notes. Then a bunch of people with large deployments hit it and their Concourse went cold. Sorry.
  
  We're removing the limit and are going to do some investigation into the ATC's connection pool characteristics before considering adding it back.

* The [BOSH deployment resource](https://github.com/concourse/bosh-deployment-resource) now supports [BOSH 2.0 manifests](http://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2.html). Previously it would explode instead.

* The ATC can now be configured to authenticate against a GitHub Enterprise deployment, thanks to @aequitas!

* Cleaned up some internals to fix the root cause some noisy but harmless log lines (`failed-to-lookup-ttl`).

* The [Docker Image resource](https://github.com/concourse/docker-image-resource) should now be more durable to flaky Docker registries, by retrying with exponential backoff on network errors or `5xx` responses.

* Previously the [Pool resource](https://github.com/concourse/pool-resource) would require you to specify `retry_delay` in nanoseconds, which was a bit silly. It now accepts Go duration format, e.g. `30s`.
