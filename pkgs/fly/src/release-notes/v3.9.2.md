#### <sub><sup><a name="v392-note-1" href="#v392-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* Due to popular demand, we're graduating the pipeline dashboard out of beta and back into `/dashboard`. You can now also do useful things like log in and click through to the normal pipeline and build pages.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v392-note-2" href="#v392-note-2">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* The NewRelic metrics emitter has now been improved thanks to @novas0x2a!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v392-note-3" href="#v392-note-3">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Removed a pesky database constraint (`cannot_invalidate_during_initialization`). This would occasionally bubble up to the user in weird ways, and actually isn't necessary any more.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v392-note-4" href="#v392-note-4">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* The previous release snuck some code that wasn't quite ready yet into the BOSH release and broke registration of external workers. This is now fixed.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v392-note-5" href="#v392-note-5">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Occasionally builds would fail when interacting with Vault with `http2: no cached connection was available`. NO LONGER! (We, uh, we bumped a dependency.)
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v392-note-6" href="#v392-note-6">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Certain ANSI cursor movement escape sequences would wreak havoc on the Concourse build output page because there was no window size set on the TTY, thus defaulting it to `80x24`. We've set it to `500x500`. That oughtta do it.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v392-note-7" href="#v392-note-7">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Fixed an issue where Firefox users couldn't click around on the build page.
