#### <sub><sup><a name="v391-note-1" href="#v391-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* The build page will now render exotic ANSI text modes like faint text, framed text (...?), and... Fraktur (??????).
  
  This is a feature, but I'll be damned if it's what makes us go to 3.10.
  
  If you're wondering what Fraktur looks like, check out the [pull request](https://github.com/concourse/web/pull/2). Thanks, @evanphx!
  
  If you're wondering why that's a standard, keep wondering.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v391-note-2" href="#v391-note-2">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* We've optimized the rendering of the build page, which got quite a bit slower with the introduction of timestamps in [**v3.6.0**](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v3.6.0). There is more work to do here, but we've added performance tests to catch any future egregious regressions.

* The BOSH release's `credhub.client_id` and `credhub.client_secret` properties are now respected once again. Ironically this broke when we added CredHub testing to our pipeline, but in a way that avoided UAA client ID/secret configuration as it was much too heavyweight (hence the introduction of TLS auth properties).

* Fixed a BOSH release template resolution error from an undefined `esc` method, which would only occur on a clean deploy thanks to the magic of global state. This is an example of why using Ruby to generate Bash scripts is a terrible idea.
  
  Thanks to @calebwashburn for discovering the issue and PR-ing a fix!

* Cleaned up those pesky `atc.skymarshal.user.not-authorized` logs.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v391-note-6" href="#v391-note-6">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Fixed a crash that would occur when a [`task` step](https://concourse-ci.org/task-step.html) configured [**`image`**](https://concourse-ci.org/task-step.html#task-step-image) but no [**`config`**](https://concourse-ci.org/task-step.html#task-step-config) or [**`file`**](https://concourse-ci.org/task-step.html#task-step-file).
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v391-note-7" href="#v391-note-7">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* The [`fly` CLI](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html) will now buffer output when rendering tables, which should make things a bit faster on Windows.
