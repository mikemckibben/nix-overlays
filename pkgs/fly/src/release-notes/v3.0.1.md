#### <sub><sup><a name="v301-note-1" href="#v301-note-1">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Fixed a regression in the handling of [`put` step](https://concourse-ci.org/put-step.html)s that have no inputs. Prior to [**v3.0.0**](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v3.0.0) we would ensure that the directory given to `/opt/resource/out` would exist even if there are no inputs, so that resources don't have to do a `mkdir -p`.
  
  We now once again ensure the directory exists, and have coverage to ensure this doesn't happen again.

* Fixed a regression in [`task` step](https://concourse-ci.org/task-step.html)s causing their [**`params`**](https://concourse-ci.org/task-step.html#task-step-params) to not be set in the environment when hijacking. This got lost in a cleanup and is now handled in a much simpler way, and also tested so it doesn't regress again.

* The [`fly set-pipeline`](https://concourse-ci.org/setting-pipelines.html#fly-set-pipeline) command will now exit 0 if the user bails out.
