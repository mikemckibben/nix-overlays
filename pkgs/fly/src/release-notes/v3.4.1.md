* Looks like the GC "fixes" had the opposite effect of making containers linger around longer than usual. You might want to skip this version for now. Otherwise, hang tight while we get this sorted out.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v341-note-2" href="#v341-note-2">:link:</a></sup></sub> breaking

* Removed a feature introduced in v3.4.0 that lets you authenticate into a team using personal GitHub tokens.
  
  GitHub's API surprisingly accepts oAuth tokens in the same flow as access tokens. This makes the GitHub auth flow supported by Concourse less secure, as oAuth tokens may be acquired by an exploited third-party service that users have authorized, thereby allowing them to log in to the user's CI system.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v341-note-3" href="#v341-note-3">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* The `fly` command for [`fly set-team`](https://concourse-ci.org/managing-teams.html#fly-set-team) and [`fly destroy-team`](https://concourse-ci.org/managing-teams.html#fly-destroy-team) now lets you supply the flag `--non-interactive`. Such automation. Amaze.
  
  Thanks to @aleksey-hariton for the PR!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v341-note-4" href="#v341-note-4">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* BaggageClaim volume creation APIs are now asynchronous; this should remove the need for crazy timeouts.
  
  Thanks to @SHyx0rmZ for implementing this!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v341-note-5" href="#v341-note-5">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* `fly` now prints a URL to your build page when you run [`fly execute`](https://concourse-ci.org/running-tasks.html#fly-execute). How convenient!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v341-note-6" href="#v341-note-6">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Deleting teams would cause the garbage collector to freak out and cause a buildup of worker containers.
  
  That's been fixed now.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v341-note-7" href="#v341-note-7">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Added the appropriate headers to stop GitHub from caching badges.
  
  Thanks to @belljustin and @cunnie for fixing this longstanding issue!
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v341-note-8" href="#v341-note-8">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Fixed an issue where the pipeline view  will reset after a state change on the pipeline.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v341-note-9" href="#v341-note-9">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Previously, if a resource or resource type was parameterized via a credential manager, its check containers and caches would be mistakenly garbage-collected. They will now be kept around.
  
  
#### <sub><sup><a name="v341-note-10" href="#v341-note-10">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Check containers will no longer be brutally destroyed if they're used too close to their expiration time.
